# Computer Components Overview

This guide provides an overview of the basic components of a computer.

## Power Components

### Always-on Circuits
- Certain circuits are always powered, even when the computer is off or in standby mode.
- These circuits enable functions like wake-on-LAN and remote power-on.

### Power Button
- Pressing the power button sends a signal to the motherboard to turn on, shut down, or enter standby mode.

### Hard Power Cycle
- Disconnecting the power supply from the computer for a short period can help fix hardware issues or reset the system.

## Front Panel Connectors

### Reset Button
- Pressing the reset button performs a hard reset of the computer, restarting it and performing POST (Power-on Self Test).

### Power Light
- Indicates the power status of the computer.

### Hard Disk Light
- Flashes when the hard drive or SSD is being accessed.

### Audio Connectors
- Used to connect speakers and microphones.

### USB Connectors
- Used to connect various peripherals like keyboards, mice, and flash drives.

## Drive Bays

### 5.25-inch Drive Bay
- Traditionally used for optical drives, but can also accommodate other devices like card readers and displays.

### 3.5-inch Drive Bay
- Traditionally used for floppy drives, but now mostly used for devices like card readers and external USB ports.

## Airflow

### Importance of Proper Airflow
- Proper airflow is crucial for keeping the computer cool and preventing overheating.
- Air typically flows from the front of the computer to the back, passing over the motherboard and exiting via the power supply.
- Missing blanking panels, poor cable management, and dust can disrupt airflow and affect cooling performance.

## Additional Notes

- Unplug the computer before performing maintenance to prevent electrical damage.
- The front I/O panel has various connectors for different components and peripherals.
