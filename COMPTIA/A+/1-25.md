Video Summary: Adapter Cables
Adapter cables are used to change or extend one connector to another. They come in two main types: passive and active.

Passive cables: Have no or minimal electronics. They are generally cheaper and only have basic features like changing voltages.
Active cables: Have additional electronics to convert or boost the signal. They are generally more expensive but can transmit signals over longer distances and more reliably. Some active cables require external power to work.
When buying an adapter cable, you should check if it is passive or active. Additionally, check the technical specifications such as supported resolution (for video cables) and USB standard support (for USB cables).

Some examples of common adapter cables:

HDMI to VGA
HDMI to DisplayPort
HDMI to DVI
USB-C to USB-A
Lightning to USB
When using adapter cables, make sure they are compatible with your devices and are powered externally if necessary.
