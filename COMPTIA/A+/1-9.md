Summary
This video covers Molex connectors, their historical context, current usage in computing, and the importance of proper installation to prevent damage.

Highlights
🔌 Molex connectors are four-pin power connectors primarily used for older devices.
📅 First introduced in the 1950s by the Molex company.
⚙️ Mainly found in case fans, but rarely in new devices.
⚠️ Improper connection can lead to device damage or shorts.
💾 The Berg connector, often called a floppy disk connector, is also legacy.
🔄 Molex and Berg connectors deliver 12V and 5V, but not 3.3V.
🛠️ Adapters are available but may lack 3.3V power, not usually needed for most devices.
Key Insights
🔋 Molex Connectors: These connectors are becoming obsolete but remain relevant for specific legacy hardware, highlighting the transition in power supply technologies.
🏭 Historical Significance: Understanding the origins of Molex connectors provides insight into the evolution of computer hardware and design standards over decades.
⏳ Current Usage: Despite being outdated, Molex connectors are still seen in case fans and card readers, emphasizing that older technologies can persist in niche applications.
⚡ Installation Risks: Improper installation can lead to electrical shorts, underlining the importance of careful handling and awareness when connecting hardware.
📼 Berg Connector: While often referred to as a floppy disk connector, its legacy status illustrates the broader trend of phasing out older technologies in favor of more efficient solutions.
🔌 Power Specifications: Both Molex and Berg connectors provide 12V and 5V, but the absence of 3.3V can limit compatibility with modern devices, reflecting the evolving power requirements in computing.
⚙️ Adaptability: The availability of adapters shows the ongoing need to bridge legacy and modern technologies, ensuring users can still connect older components when necessary.
