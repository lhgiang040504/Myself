This video provides an overview of liquid cooling systems. Liquid cooling systems use a liquid, typically water, to cool the CPU and other components like GPUs. They are generally better than air cooling for removing heat. Liquid cooling systems come in open and closed loop versions. Closed loop systems, also known as all-in-one (AIO) systems, are pre-assembled and sealed, making them easier to install and maintain. Open loop systems are customizable but require more maintenance and have a higher risk of leaks. The two main components of liquid cooling systems are the block and the radiator. The block is attached to the CPU or other components, and the radiator transfers heat to the air. The pump is another important component of the system. It circulates the water and transfers heat away from the CPU. To install a liquid cooling system, you will need to attach the block to the CPU, connect the pump and radiator, and fill the system with coolant.
