Performance Issues
Performance issues can be one of the hardest problems to diagnose, because performance problems don’t always crash the computer; they just make it run slower than it should. This is because modern computers have thermal controls. Essentially, components in the computer monitor their own temperature and reduce their performance if the temperature starts getting too high. Higher performance generates more heat; thus, one way to reduce the heat in components is to reduce performance.

Therefore, if your computer is not performing at its optimal speed, it is advisable to check the temperature sensors of its components. Many components in the computer are equipped with thermal monitoring that indicates their operating temperatures. Consult the manufacturer's guidelines to determine the ideal temperature range for these components. Should you notice that the temperatures are higher than recommended during idle periods, this could be a sign that the computer's cooling system isn't functioning as efficiently as it should.

Another indication of a cooling problem is the fan speeds. When the computer starts getting hotter, the fans will get faster. Depending on the computer, you may hear the fans spinning faster. If the computer is at idle and the fans are spinning faster than normal, this is an indication that the cooling is not working as well as it should be.

The problem might stem from a fan requiring cleaning. For instance, using compressed air to blow out dust from the fan can help resolve the issue. Additionally, ensure that no cables are obstructing the fan's movement. A fan hindered by cables or clogged with dust will struggle to spin at the necessary speed, thus impeding airflow. Remember, adequate airflow is crucial for fan efficiency. Therefore, keeping the air vents unblocked is essential for keeping the computer cool.

If you find cleaning does not help, you may need to replace or upgrade the cooling inside the computer. To get the best performance, the cooling inside your computer needs to be working effectively.

Check for Misconfiguration
Misconfiguration often results in decreased performance. If you observe a slowdown after an upgrade or maintenance, it's crucial to examine any recent modifications to identify potential causes of the issue.

For example, adding an extra memory module that is not compatible with those already present may disable dual channel. It may also reduce the clock speed of the other memory modules. Either can reduce the performance of the computer.

Installing a second video card for an additional monitor could potentially impact your computer's performance. The CPU provides a finite number of lanes for video card connectivity. Adding a second card might divide these lanes, thereby reducing the allocation to the primary video card. The specific slot used for the video card often dictates the number of lanes it utilizes. Additionally, in some instances, adjustments can be made in the computer's setup to configure the number of lanes allocated to each video card.

The key takeaway here is that adding new hardware can unexpectedly alter your computer's performance. It's crucial to ensure compatibility and understand the potential impact of integrating new components with an existing setup.

Verify the Problem
Numerous factors can lead to slowdown in a computer's performance. Often this is due to a bottleneck, where one component's limitations hinder the overall system's efficiency. A bottleneck is like having a car equipped with an exceptionally powerful engine, yet fitted with small, narrow tires. These tires, due to their limited size and grip, will spin and struggle to handle the excessive power output of the engine, thereby constraining the maximum performance that the engine can deliver.

In computing, consider a computer with high-speed memory and a powerful graphics processor. If it's paired with a low-end CPU that struggles to transfer data quickly enough to the graphics card, the graphics card won't operate at its full potential, due to the slow data transfer rate. This imbalance in component capabilities is what typically causes a bottleneck in system performance.
