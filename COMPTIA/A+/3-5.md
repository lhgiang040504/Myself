This video provides a comprehensive guide on troubleshooting power supply problems in computers. It covers two main types of power issues: no power and intermittent power.

No Power:

Check for physical signs of power: Look for lights on the computer's front panel and spinning fans.
Test the power button: Press and hold the power button for a few seconds.
Inspect motherboard lights: Look for any lights indicating power is reaching the motherboard.
Check other devices: Verify if other equipment on the same circuit is working.
Test the power cable: Plug the computer into a different outlet or connect it to a monitor.
Remove extra devices: Temporarily remove non-essential devices to reduce power draw.
Intermittent Power:

Check for overloading: Ensure the power supply is not overloaded.
Monitor for circuit breaker trips: Listen for clicking sounds or check for resettable circuit breakers.
Test power stability: Use a power supply meter to measure voltage, amps, and watts.
Consider power supply age: Older power supplies may have degraded performance.
Use a power supply tester: Verify if the power supply is outputting the correct voltages.
Additional Tips:

Methodically remove devices: Isolate the faulty component by removing devices one by one.
Use a multimeter: Measure voltages, resistance, and current for further diagnostics.
Remember: Always prioritize safety when troubleshooting electrical components.
