Startup Process
To effectively troubleshoot startup issues with your computer, I will first look at a typical startup process. This knowledge provides a foundational basis for identifying and resolving problems that may arise during startup. By examining each step of the startup sequence, this will help you troubleshoot where a problem may be.

Starting the computer involves sending a start signal to the motherboard, usually accomplished by pressing the power button. However, other methods can also trigger this process, such as wake events from specific hardware components such as a network card.

The start signal is sent to the power supply. This essentially tells the power supply to start up. Once the power supply is ready to start sending power, it sends a ‘power good’ signal to the computer.

The 'power good' signal informs the CPU that it's ready to boot up. For the CPU to start operations, it requires specific instructions located on a chip within the motherboard, typically the BIOS or UEFI chip. These instructions are then transferred to the memory for execution.

Upon startup, the computer conducts a hardware check known as the Power-On-Self-Test or POST. During this process, it tests various components to ensure they are functioning correctly. If POST detects any issues or everything is in order, it typically signals this through beeps from the PC speaker or it may provide a message on the screen.

In some cases when there is a problem, you will get a series of beeps or a message to let you know what the problem is. However, if anything goes wrong before this process, the only thing that you may get is a black screen. To start with, let’s look at how you would troubleshoot a black screen.

Black Screen
During your IT career, switching on a computer and encountering a 'black screen' issue is quite common, and it can be challenging to resolve due to the lack of error messages or clear indications of the problem's cause. One question you should ask is has anything changed. A recent change may have caused the problem.

In troubleshooting a black screen, inquire if any new hardware has been added, firmware updated, or if there have been changes to the computer's setup. Sometimes, adjustments in the BIOS or UEFI settings can render the computer unbootable. In such cases, resetting these settings to their default state might be necessary to resolve the issue.

When troubleshooting a black screen, it's important to determine if a recent firmware update was applied and whether it was successful. If the update failed, a system with a dual-chip design, where there are two BIOS/UEFI chips, can be advantageous; You can switch to the backup chip to start the computer. Modern computers typically have the BIOS chip soldered onto the motherboard, making it non-replaceable, which is a shift from older designs where the BIOS chip could be physically removed and replaced. If you encounter a firmware-related failure and don't have a dual-chip system, contacting the manufacturer for assistance would be the next step.

Check Cabling
One of the initial steps is to thoroughly check all the cables. Often, a loose connection is the simple cause of the problem. Ensure that every cable is securely and properly connected. Double-check each connection for a firm and complete fit to eliminate any potential loose or partially connected cables, which can often be the root cause of such issues.

When troubleshooting a black screen, it's important to ensure cables are fully inserted. Sometimes, a cable might seem connected but isn't plugged in all the way, which can be deceptive. For cables with locking connectors, ensure they click into place and don't easily pull out. This indicates a secure connection. For cables without locks, make sure they are firmly pushed in. You will notice that when I pull on this cable, it comes out. Properly secured connections are crucial for ensuring all components communicate effectively and could be the simple fix needed for screen issues.
