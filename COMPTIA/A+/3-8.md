Drive Availability
Storage devices contain our valuable data. Hard disks, when they fail, do so generally because of mechanical problems. Factors like running time and heat reduce a hard disk’s lifespan. However, performing functions like reading and writing doesn’t tend to reduce the lifespan of a hard disk.

In contrast, Solid-State-Drives generally last longer and are more reliable than hard disks. However, wear increases if more writes are performed on a Solid-State-Drive. The other point to consider is that, if power is lost, this can cause damage or file corruption. This is a particular concern if the storage device is in the middle of write operations.

Let’s have a look at some of the things to look for to help you determine if there is a problem.

Hard Disk Normal Startup Sounds
To start diagnosing a hard disk, it is first a good idea to understand what it sounds like under normal conditions. When a hard disk first powers up, it will do some basic checks. You should hear the motor spin up. A check is done of the hard disk head and some configuration information is read. It should sound like this.

If you don't hear the typical sounds from a hard disk, it might indicate a problem. These sounds are often quiet and hard to detect. You can try feeling the hard disk for vibrations, especially when it first spins up. USB hard disks might be harder to hear due to them often being inside a plastic enclosure. Normally, you should hear the motor spin up followed by the read/write head moving, then returning to its parked position. If the motor spins but the head remains still, the drive might be failing, but remember, some drives are quieter than others.

Normal Operation
During normal operation, a functioning hard disk typically emits a soft buzzing sound, which is the read/write head moving across the disk's platter. This sound is a normal indicator of the disk's reading and writing activities. It sounds something like this.

During normal operations, you should hear a random soft clicking noise of the head moving – it should be pretty random and quiet in nature. If it is a loud clicking and not random, there may be a problem with the hard disk. Let’s have a look.

Click-Click
If you ever hear a clicking noise from the hard disk, this is the sound of the hard disk head resetting itself and trying again. It may mean the hard disk needs to be replaced and could sound something like this.

A repetitive clicking noise from a hard drive often signifies that the drive is repeatedly resetting and attempting an operation again. This behaviour is commonly observed when encountering a bad sector or when there's damage to a disk platter. In the case of a bad sector, the drive struggles to read from that sector, fails and retries. If the platter is damaged, the drive head may become stuck at the damaged area, unable to move past it. As a result, the drive resets itself in an attempt to try again.

Once you know what a healthy hard disk sounds like, any other noises like grinding noises or clicking noises are a sign of mechanical problems. Consider replacing the hard disk. Let’s have a look at what other signs you can look for.
