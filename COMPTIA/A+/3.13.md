Functions of the Clock
The clock inside your computer is used in a lot of different ways; thus, it is important to make sure it is set correctly. For example, the clock is used for timestamps. Timestamps are used when creating a file. The modification timestamp is generally updated when the data in the file is changed. However, different operating systems may also change it at other times, for example, when permissions are changed. When the accessed timestamp is updated, it is very operating system specific. By default, in older versions of Windows this was always updated, then by default it was disabled. In newer versions, Windows will only update it under certain circumstances. So don’t rely on accessed time as always being correct.

If the clock is set incorrectly, you can’t rely on the information in the timestamps being right. This will also affect backups as it will make it harder for the computer to determine what files have changed since the last backup.

The clock is also used for validation, for example, when accessing secure websites, and logins to services like Windows domain. If you find that you can’t authenticate, it may be that the time is set incorrectly. In Windows, if the time is out by more than five minutes, you won’t be able to login.

The time and date that you are shown is also adjusted by a time zone. Before changing the time, I would first check that the time zone is correct.

The clock is also used when creating log files. If the clock changes, since the log files are written sequentially, the timestamps won’t appear in order. This makes it much harder to troubleshoot problems.

Adherence to legal compliance requirements is a critical aspect of business operations, particularly concerning the accurate recording of employee timesheets. This mandates the necessity for precise timekeeping. Ensuring that all clocks and time-tracking systems are correctly synchronized and set is not only a matter of regulatory compliance but also a cornerstone of maintaining trust and integrity in the workplace. Accurate time recording is essential for upholding labor laws, calculating wages, and meeting audit standards. It is therefore vital for organizations to regularly verify and calibrate their timekeeping devices to align with legal mandates.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
Before I start looking at time, I first need to look at Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. This is the primary standard used to regulate time in the world. There is not too much to know about it other than it is the central reference point. UTC does not belong to a specific time zone or geographical location, but is the reference point that the time zone offset is applied to, to get local time.

Modern PCs and operating systems are designed to maintain time using UTC. To present the correct local time to users, the system applies the appropriate time zone offset and accounts for daylight saving time when applicable. While users interact with and view their local time, the operating system consistently operates using UTC in the background. This ensures accurate timekeeping regardless of any changes in a user's time zone. For user convenience, the displayed time is seamlessly converted from UTC to local time.

Real Time Clock (RTC)
The computer has a real time clock otherwise known as RTC. If the power is disconnected, a battery on the motherboard will keep providing power to the clock. On older computers, the battery also kept the computer’s configuration powered. In modern computer systems, configuration settings are stored in non-volatile flash memory, which preserves the configuration without the need for a power supply. This ensures that the computer retains its configuration even when it's powered off.

Modern operating systems use Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Very old operating systems use local time. Your BIOS may support UTC time. Modern computers should support UTC, while older computers may not.
