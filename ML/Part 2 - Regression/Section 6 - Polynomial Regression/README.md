# WHY 'LINEAR'

## Regresison: 
    When talking about the class of regression, so whether it is linear or non-linear

## Coefficients: 
    The question is can the function be expressed as a linear combination of these coefficients


# POLINOMIAL REGRESSION
## Poly reg
    y = b0 + b1.x1 + b2.(x1^2) + ... + bn.(x1^n)
