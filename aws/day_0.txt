Intro
There are three different kinds of deployment models:

Cloud-based
	Everything runs in the cloud.
	These are diffirent levels of services ranging from low to high.
	The level of service has diffirent requirements on your management, architecting, and infrastructures.
On-premises
	Deploy resources by using virtualization and recource management tools, also is known as private cloud deployment.
	Though this model is much loke legacy IT infrastructure, its application management and virtualization technologies make it more effective.
Hybrid
	You connect cloud recources to an on-premises infrastruture.
	This approach is relevant in amny situations.

Benefits:
	Cost savings 
	Security
	Scalability
	Flexibility
Payment Model
Fewer Operation
Flexible Capacity
Economies at Scale
Inreaseed Speed

AWS EC2 : Elastic Cloud Compute
It makes the process of increasing and decreasing capacity easier.
As a result, you can access the recource at demand.
No upfront investment is needed
You only pay for what you need and it is secure.

Get started with AWS EC2  in three steps :
Launch -> Connect -> Use
