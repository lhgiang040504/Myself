1. Launch
	Start with selecting a template with basic configurations.
	The config include the operating system, application server, or application.
	Nex, decide the instance type and hardware configuration of your instance.
	Finally, specify the security settings to control the traffic in and out of your instance.

2. Connect
	There are many ways to connect an instance.
	Programs and applications have multiple connection methods to exchange data.
	User can connect and access he computer destop by logging in.

3. Use
	Once connected, you can use the instance.
	Execute commands to install software, add storage, copy, and organize files, and much more.

AWS EC2 Instance Types

the General Purpopes Instaces balances computing, memory, and networking resources.
	Application servers
	Gaming servers
	Backend server for companies
	Small and medium databases
the General Purpose Instances are best when there is a balance between the resources.

the Compute Optimized Instaces are best these is a need for high ccompute. This type is also good for application servers, gaming servers, and web applications.
the main diffirence is that this type is ideal for hight-performance and compute-intensive needs.

the Memory Optimized Instances can deliver large dataaset workloads fast.
Memory is a temporary storage area.
It loads from storage, holds the data, and processes it before the compute can run it.
The processing allows for a preloading process and gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.
This type are best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.

the Accelerated COmputing INstances use hardware accelerators.
The accelerators boost the data processing.
This type are best for graphics applications and streaming.

the Storage Optimized Instances is best when you have large datasets on local storage.
	Large file systems
	Data warehouses
	Online transaction systems
This type are desghned to deliver amny inputs as fast as possible.
