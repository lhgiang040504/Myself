 Superior Digital Atore of Value

Transaction : without centralized
intermediary

Etherium
	decentralized agreement
	decentralized organization

remove centralized forces and counterparty risk

Etherium vs Bitcoin : Bitcoin are intentionally touring incomplete. Bitcoin developers viewed Bitcoin as a store of value while Etherium developers viewed Etherium as both a store of value and utility to facilitate these decentralized agreement

Blockchain cannot interact with real world data -> Oracle problem

Oracle is a divice that delivers data to these decentralized blockchain

on-chain logic need off-chain data and decentralize computation

Hybrid Smart Contracts : on-chain + off-chain Agreement

chainlink : Decentralized oracle network -- both bring external data and external computation into our smart contract to sue decentralized end-to-end

L2 solve the scalability issuse
	Optimistic Roll-Up
	Zero Knowledge Rollups

DAPP = Decentralized Application = Decentralized Protocol = Smart Contract
