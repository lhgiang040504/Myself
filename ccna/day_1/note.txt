to know how switches are amazing, we need to look at their predecessor - hub , is disgusting, dumb and doesnt smart

ping ip_address

the job of the switch is learning where everyone is by learning mac address

hub - sent the frame to every member of the network
switch - sent to the correct one
wireless access point (wap) - like a hub with cable is wave

everything we know that have layer1, layer2, layer3 - main layers
	layer1 - physical layer
	layer2 - MAC address
	layer3 - IP address

MAC - Media Access Control
CAM - Content Addressable Memory (table) == switch table
	is used by a switch to discover the relationship between the layer2 of device and the physical port
IP - Internet Protocol

NIC - Network Interface Card
