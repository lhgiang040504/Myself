the only language that switch speak with is layer2

ping with IP address, only sender know about receiver

same IP network
--
source IP - sender
destination IP - receiver
source MAC - sender
destination MAC - broadcast address
--
 * broadcast address send to everybody except sender
--
find MAC address that tied to receiver IP
send needed frame
--


so what happend when we try to get to the outer network 

--
source IP - sender
* destination IP - receiver IP  be transmitted to gateway of sender's IP network that used for router
source MAC - sender
destination MAC - broadcast address
--

case : switch connect directly to another switch
-> be trying but wont get any respond

case : switches are connected via router
-> router use gateway address
router help to connect between vary networks
