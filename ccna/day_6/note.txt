heart palpitations
get risk of 'a single-point of failure' - expensive

note both case cable and even switch/router go down

multilayer switch (l3) IP and MAC address, stronger

distribution layer == aggregation layer == route filting == ... *== collapsed core layer

add core layer to 3-tier architecture
it comes in because of the problem that too mass of connect from vary number of architecture
core layer : a beast switch that *beautiful powerful, low latency and high reliability
