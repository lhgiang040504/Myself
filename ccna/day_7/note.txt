a data center is all about server connecting to things and the internet

big companies have their owned data center, so how about companies aren't big.The answer is yes but not all in the same way

own data center doesn't always mean having a massive wahrehouse with ton of servers, may be it just be one room with one rack.


own data center
rent some rask space in a data center
cloud - hybrid cloud

old design:
rack
_
tor switch - top of rack
server1
server2
...
_
		core switch		: core layer
	M-switch	M-switch	: distribution / aggregation layer
rack		rack		rak	: access layer

						core switch

	M-switch	M-switch					M-switch	M-switch	

rack		rack		rack				rack		rack		rack	


we have a huge problem, it used to be north-south traffic. How about server want to talk to another server.

this type of traffic was not important untill virtualization came in. With virtualization, the date center became more distributed, we call it is east-west traffic get 80% traffic with data center.
The old wast too many hops to communication that nedds.

Spanning tree, it'll shut down links (redundant links) and keep other one active avoiding switching loop so 3-tier design not for data centers.


new design:
rack:
_
leaf switch
server1
server2
...
_
spine <- backbone
spine/leaf design (clos)
spine switch themself dont connect to each other

		Spine switch		Spine switch		Spine switch
	

rack		rack		rack				rack		rack		rak	



leaf switch connectd to spine switch is not layer2, it's layer3 ** why
ton of above is underlay network
